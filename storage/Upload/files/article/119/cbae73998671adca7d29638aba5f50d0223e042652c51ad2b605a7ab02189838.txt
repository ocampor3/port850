Product Testibng

	A detailed understanding of how your product meets (or doesn’t meet) your customer’s needs is crucial both to product development and marketing, so these types of market research studies need to be conducted throughout a product’s life.

	Ultimately you should be able to make informed “go” or “not go” decisions about new features and products before launch, and thus save capital, time and effort.

Successful product testing should:

-Give insight into product/service viability by investigating competing and substitute alternatives along side customers’ willingness to embrace new products/services.
-Determine competitive advantage as well as possible threats from similar products/services.
-Identify the products with the highest revenue potential.
Clarify what improvements should be prioritized before a product launch (or re-launch).
-Pinpoint which product features (both existing and potential) are most important to your target audience.
-Help produce marketing messages to change or enhance existing perceptions about your products/services.
